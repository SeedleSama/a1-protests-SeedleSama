# Assignment 1: Protests
This repository contains code and analysis of protests in the United States, using data from [CountLove](https://countlove.org/).


## Background Research
Before diving into this (or any) dataset, it's important to have _domain familiarity_ (i.e., to know something about the topic). As preparation, you should locate and read _three (3)_ articles about public protests in the U.S.. These can be news articles or more holistic analysis pieces (e.g., as might be in an online magazine or publication).

In this section of the `README.md` file, create an _unordered list_ of the three articles you found. For each article in the list, provide a link to the article (in Markdown formatting, with display text other than the URL) _as well as_ a 1-2 sentence summary or takeaway/thesis from each one.


## Representative Image
A picture is, as they say, worth many words. Images are great at increasing engagement with your analysis as well as conveying the point of your analysis. Find and download at least _one (1)_ image to accompany your analysis, saving the file in the provided `img/` folder in your repo.

In this section of the `README.md` file, display the image from your `img/` folder (remember to use a _relative path_!). Below that image, include 2-3 sentences captioning the image. Your caption should both identify the image as well as explain _why_ you included that image in particular. As practice, use either **bold** or _italic_ text when captioning your image.


## Analysis Reflections
As you follow the instructions in the `analysis.R` file, you will be prompted to write six (6) _reflections_ interpreting the results of your code. Those reflections should do in this section.

Each reflection should be about 1-2 sentences long. You can organize the reflections into an _ordered list_ or otherwise label which is which.


## Conclusion
Once you are finished with your analysis (you've completed the `analysis.R` file), fill in this section by answering the following questions (in about 1-2 sentences each):

1. What results from the analysis surprised you? Why?
2. What parts of the analysis did you find most challenging?
3. What kind of analysis do you wish you were able to do with the dataset (but perhaps don't have the technical skills to do so)?
